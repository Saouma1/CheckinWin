      <!-- Who We Are Section -->
      <div class="who_we_are" data-aos="fade-up">
        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>At CheckinWin, our journey began with a frustration we knew many people face. As students, 
            we struggled to manage countless loyalty cards—chasing deals and rewards, only to miss out
             because we couldn’t keep track. It was clear there had to be a better way.

            From that frustration, CheckinWin was born. Our goal? To simplify loyalty programs for 
            everyone—not just students, but anyone who values convenience and loves getting the most out of their purchases.
            </p></div>

      <!-- What We Do Section -->
      <div class="what_we_do" data-aos="fade-up">

        <p>We created CheckinWin because we know firsthand how frustrating it can be to miss out on rewards or feel disconnected from local businesses.

              everyone. Whether you’re looking for free coffee after your tenth purchase or discounts at your favorite stores,
